<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>A little background info about me:D</h2>
<p>My name is Aruzhan Bapaikhan but everyone calls me Aruka. I am 24 years old.  </p>

<p>Last year I graduated from Nazarbayev University with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and International Relations. 
  It's got to be interesting why I am, a 24 y.o. IR student, creating the website. It has to do with the fact that I always wanted 
  to be a software engineer, not just an ordinary engineer who creates websites, but a software engineer working in the game-dev. 
  Since I think it is never too late to learn something new and evolve, I decided to take the "Full-Stack Web Developer" course 
  from Angela Yu and try my hand at programming. I enjoy this course and hope it is the tip of the iceberg in my journey of 
  getting into the IT sphere.</p>

<p>I speak three languages: Russian, Kazakh and English. My hobbies include reading books, especially of anti-utopia and novel genre.
  Besides that I am a huge fan of video games. My first video game was "The Sims 2", which I bought in 2009 when I got my first PC.
I also like cooking by combining various ingredients that I am able to find in the kitchen. </p>

<p>I characterize myself as an agile, attentive to detail, empathic person with the ability to think critically.
  I always strive to follow a work ethic and collaborate with other people to expand my network. I have good oral and writing skills,
  and consider myself a fast-learner and a multi-tasker.</p>
